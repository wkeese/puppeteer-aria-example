# Pupeteer ARIA selectors test / example

This is a test of the aria selectors in pupeteer.

Before running the test, go to another shell and run:

```
npx http-server
```

That serves the index.html page on port 8080.

Then in second shell, switch to node 20 or higher:

```
nvm use 20
```

and run the test:

```
node test.mjs
```
